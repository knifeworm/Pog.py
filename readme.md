Hello this the github for Pog.py and if u try to copy this code it wont work as some files have been hidden for the repo and without those files the bot won't work.

Any way if u are looking to learn how to make a bot i recommend this youtube channel to follow their tutorials as that is how i learnt on how to make a discord bot for python myself.

This code might also help you if you are stuck on something and just need to pinch some that is fine but stealing the whole code and turning it into your own bot is not ok. Which is why somefiles are not on the repo.

Have fun coding!
